# Housing Price Regression Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict housing prices based on various features of the houses. The model is trained using the XGBoost algorithm, which is known for its efficiency and accuracy in regression tasks. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, as well as a web application for making predictions.
